# Gridle Python

Non web development code for creating the charts of gridle:

## Setup

Use `conda` or `mamba` to install dependencies in an environment.

```
mamba env create --name gridle --file environment.yml
```

Activate the environment:

```
mamba activate gridle
```

## Contents

Right now there's just one notebook called `gridle-init.ipynb` that
pulls some PUDL data and creates plotly charts.
